# Bends

__Bends__ is an interactive model demonstrating how massive objects warp spacetime. One User may enjoy dragging a singular massive object through a hypothetical spacetime box, thus distorting the boxes coordinate system and evoking the feeling of omniscience in said One User. One User may find that they would prefer to simplify increase or decrease the mass of a singular massive object in a hypothetical spacetime box, and is encouraged to do so if so inclined!

## Technologies:

-  `Javascript`
- `three.js` - camera angle and scene
- `D3.js` - 
- `newton` - for general mathematical ease

## Timeline:

Day 1: learn relevant technologies/apis

Day 2: create 3D cartesian plane and rotatable camera view

Day 3: create point mass and have it bend grid according to Newton's law of universal gravitation

Day Bonus: be able to move point mass and affect surrounding grid properly // increase or decrease mass of object
