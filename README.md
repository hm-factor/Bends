# Bends

__Bends__ is an interactive model demonstrating how massive objects warp spacetime. One User may enjoy dragging a singular massive object through a hypothetical spacetime box, thus distorting the boxes coordinate system and evoking the feeling of omniscience in said One User. One User may find that they would prefer to simply increase or decrease the mass of a singular massive object in a hypothetical spacetime box, and is encouraged to do so if so inclined. A combination of parameter altering actions is similarly encouraged.
